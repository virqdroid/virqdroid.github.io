I am a cybersecurity expert and researcher. My latest roles were `Head of Threat Intelligence Platforms` and `Head of Mobile Threat Intelligence & Security` at [Avast](https://www.avast.com), a leading cybersecurity company. In those roles, I was responsible for developing and implementing strategies to detect and prevent mobile threats, such as malware and phishing attacks, across Avast's user base. Additionally, in my latest role, I was directing & leading analysts and developers in the development of Avastâ€™s core customer-centric Threat Intelligence Platform for hunting, classification, and various other stakeholders' cyber threat use cases.

I have been quoted in various media outlets, including [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/zakdoffman/2020/03/14/coronavirus-spy-apps-israel-joins-iran-and-china-tracking-citizens-smartphones-to-fight-covid-19/), [CNN](https://www.news18.com/news/tech/adware-accounts-for-major-chunk-of-mobile-malware-avast-cybersecurity-report-2534789.html), [CNET](https://www.cnet.com/tech/mobile/google-removes-stalkerware-apps-after-researchers-discover-trackers-on-play-store/), [BBC](https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-39718619),  [BleepingComputer](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/sidewinder-hackers-plant-fake-android-vpn-app-in-google-play-store/) and [Fortune](https://fortune.com/2019/07/18/google-play-store-android-stalkerware/), on issues related to mobile security and privacy. Also published research on topics such as mobile malware, adware, and banking trojans, and presented my findings at various industry conferences and events.
