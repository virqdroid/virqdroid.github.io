I am a cybersecurity expert and researcher. My latest roles were `Head of Threat Intelligence Platforms` and `Head of Mobile Threat Intelligence & Security` at [Avast](https://www.avast.com), a leading cybersecurity company. In those roles, I was responsible for developing and implementing strategies to detect and prevent mobile threats, such as malware and phishing attacks, across Avast's user base. Additionally, in my latest role, I was directing & leading analysts and developers in the development of Avastâ€™s core customer-centric Threat Intelligence Platform for hunting, classification, and various other stakeholders' cyber threat use cases.

I have been quoted in various media outlets, including Forbes, CNN, and The New York Times, on issues related to mobile security and privacy. Also published research on topics such as mobile malware, adware, and banking trojans, and presented my findings at various industry conferences and events.
