[APKLAB.io](https://apklab.io) is a **mobile threat intelligence platform** (MTIP) designed to provide the most relevant information for Android™ security researchers.

It incorporateas reliable and **fast automatic classifiers** that examine every malware strain, categorizing like with like, and creating a more complete picture of each particular malware family (all its variants, etc.). Built into the platform coherent analyses of both **static** and **dynamic** flow, meaning the MTIP also studies the behavior of every malware strain while it’s dormant as well as active [[2](https://blog.avast.com/mobile-threat-intelligence-with-apklab.io)].

If a sample is suspected to be malicious, it is then processed by Avast's in-house **custom-built static analysis tool**, **and dynamic analysis sandbox**. As the MTIP forms a complete picture of the sample, machine learning is being used to categorize it as either part of a known malware family or not. The sample then lives forever in the apklab.io database to help solve future malware strain mysteries[[2](https://blog.avast.com/mobile-threat-intelligence-with-apklab.io)].
